# Modern C# (C# 14 era) — Before/After

This repository shows how modern C# helps us write cleaner, safer, and more readable code using simple before/after examples. It is meant to be shared on GitHub and LinkedIn and to be understandable in a few minutes.

## What you’ll see
- Primary constructors — cleaner object initialization
- Collection expressions with spread — shorter list building
- Default parameters on lambdas — fewer helper methods
- Type aliases (including tuples) — clearer intent in signatures

Each feature folder contains:
```
/Features
  /PrimaryConstructors
  /CollectionExpressions
  /LambdaDefaults
  /TypeAliases
Program.cs
```

`Program.cs` prints clear section headers and the console shows “Before” and “After” outputs that match the code.

## Why it matters
- Less boilerplate means less chance of mistakes.
- Names and signatures become clearer to readers.
- New syntax keeps the intent obvious without digging through constructors or helpers.

## How to run
```
dotnet run
```
Then read the console output alongside the code files. Everything is small, self-contained, and ready for a quick review.
