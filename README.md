# C# 14 & Modern C# — Cleaner, More Readable Code

**A practical guide to modern C# features through simple Before/After comparisons.**

This repository demonstrates how C# 14 and recent updates reduce "language ceremony" and boilerplate, allowing you to focus on clear, maintainable logic.

## 🚀 How to Use This
1. **Run the App**: Execute `dotnet run` to see the results.
2. **Compare the Code**: Navigate to the `Features` folder to compare `*.Before.cs` (traditional) and `*.After.cs` (modern) implementations.

## 📂 Project Structure
* **Program.cs**: Orchestrates the live demonstrations.
* **Features/**: Subdivided by feature (e.g., Primary Constructors, Collection Expressions).
  * `*.Before.cs`: The traditional pre-modern approach.
  * `*.After.cs`: The clean, modern approach.
  * `*.Demo.cs`: Logic for the console display.

## 🛠 Features Covered
* **Primary Constructors**: Capture state directly in the class signature.
* **Collection Expressions**: Simplified `[]` syntax for lists and arrays.
* **Default Lambda Parameters**: Declaring defaults directly in lambdas.
* **Type Aliases**: Using aliases for tuples to improve readability.

By comparing the files in each feature folder, you can see exactly how C# 14 era features make code more intuitive and easier to read.
